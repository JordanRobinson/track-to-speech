Track to Speech
===============

Track to Speech was created so you never have to fumble for your phone when you can't quite place what track is playing.

It's really useful for playing music on shuffle and generated playlists.

All you need to do is start the service, and play music. Track to Speech will announce at the start of each song what the track is, and who it's by.

Currently a work in progress.

Play Store
==========

Track to speech is now on the play store, too, so you don't have to build it yourself.
